## Credits

# Starter Code

This project was developed from the started code provided by Udacity here:  https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game.

I created functionality in JavaScript, and changed a few things in the HTML and CSS.

The modal and some other functionality was found online using StackOverflow and W3 Schools.

# Dependencies

This project is written with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  If you are running an internet browser which does not support these technologies, you will need to use a different browser.

# Code Example

- When a user clicks on the first card, the time starts and the first card is flipped
- When the second card is clicked, the second card is flipped and compared to the first card
- The move counter increases with every two cards flipped
- Once two non-matching cards are flipped, they display for a short time and flip back over
- Once a match is made, the cards change color, and the cards can no longer be clicked to flip
- When all matches are made, a modal pops up displaying the star rating, move counter, and time to complete
- When a user clicks the reset or play again button, the deck shuffles, the move counter resets, the star rating resets, and the timer resets
